BING

This is an implementation using solidity programming language.


The proposed solution for the tax mapping system is to use blockchain technology and Non-
Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to create a transparent and secure platform for tax payments and
project funding. The system will allow each user to have an individual account where they can
pay their taxes. The payment details will be stored in a smart contract on the blockchain.
For every project that requires funding, a unique NFT will be created. The NFT will contain all
the necessary documentation and approvals required for the project. The smart contract will
manage the flow of funds from the user's account to the project's NFT.

When a project needs funding, the project authority can request funds from the smart
contract. Once the request is approved, the funds will be transferred to the NFT associated
with the project. All transactions and withdrawals from the NFT will be recorded on the
blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The NFT and its data will be publicly available to every taxpayer, enabling them to see how
their tax money is being utilized in each project. This will promote transparency and increase
trust between the government and the people.

Overall, this proposed solution will provide a transparent and secure platform for tax
payments and project funding, increasing trust and accountability between the government
and the people.
